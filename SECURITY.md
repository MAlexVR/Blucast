# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this fork, please report it
privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/MAlexVR/Blucast/security/advisories/new)
rather than opening a public issue. If the vulnerability also affects
upstream [Andrei9383/Blucast](https://github.com/Andrei9383/Blucast) (i.e.
it's not specific to a change made in this fork), please report it there too.

When reporting:
1. Describe the vulnerability in detail
2. Include steps to reproduce if possible
3. Suggest a fix if you have one

I will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix within 7 days for critical issues.

## Security Considerations

### Container Security
- BluCast runs inside a container with GPU access
- The container requires `--security-opt label=disable` for device access
- Network is in host mode for X11 display

### Data Privacy
- All video processing happens locally on your GPU
- No data is sent to external servers
- Configuration is stored locally in `~/.config/blucast/`

### Dependencies
- Uses NVIDIA proprietary SDK components
- Container is based on nvidia/cuda official images
